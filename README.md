# arcticwalrus.github.io

This is my personal website. It is mostly used for praticing some front end web development. 
We will see if it evolves from that in the future.

I will be trying out development with the traditional HTML, CSS and Javascript.
Eventually I will try out Jekyll and some JS libraries. These will all be stored in different branches.
